# Profiling Report

Reusable **Vue 3** library for Ascend / CANN operator profiling visualization and analysis.

Primary goal: unify the MSTT (OP DevTools) profiling UX with a pypto-like swimlane experience for the new **`.rep` / `.ncrep`** report format, while keeping MindStudio Insight for legacy **`.bin`** dumps.

- [`data/pack_rep.py`](data/pack_rep.py) / [`data/unpack_rep.py`](data/unpack_rep.py) — pack / unpack helpers

```bash
python3 data/unpack_rep.py data/out.rep /tmp/out-rep
```

## Status

Documentation, specs, process guides, and sample data. Library and test infrastructure are not scaffolded yet — see [docs/process/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/process/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the next milestone.
